### Day 5 project: Company Intelligence Assistant

## 📋 Project Overview

**Objective:** Build an intelligent assistant that automatically analyzes company websites and generates comprehensive brochures for multiple stakeholder audiences.

**Target Audiences:**
- 🎯 **Prospective Customers** - Product/service focused messaging
- 💼 **Potential Investors** - Business metrics and growth opportunities  
- 🚀 **Job Candidates** - Company culture and career opportunities

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Multi-Stage LLM Orchestration
The system employs a sophisticated two-stage approach using OpenAI's API:

1. **Content Discovery Stage**
   - Analyzes website structure and identifies relevant pages
   - Filters and prioritizes content based on relevance scores
   - Extracts key business information from multiple sources

2. **Content Generation Stage**
   - Synthesizes collected data into audience-specific content
   - Generates professional markdown-formatted brochures
   - Ensures consistent brand messaging across all materials

### Core Technologies

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Web Scraping** | BeautifulSoup | HTML parsing and content extraction |
| **AI Reasoning** | OpenAI GPT-4 | Content analysis and generation |
| **Orchestration** | Custom Pipeline | Multi-stage LLM coordination |
| **Output Format** | Markdown | Professional document formatting |

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Content Analysis Pipeline
```python
# Stage 1: Identify relevant content
relevant_links = analyze_website_structure(base_url)
```

### 2. Brochure Generation
```python
# Stage 2: Generate targeted brochures
brochure = create_brochure(company_name, website_url)
```

### 3. Streaming Response Support
For enhanced user experience, the system supports real-time response streaming:

```python
stream = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": get_brochure_user_prompt(company_name, url)}
    ],
    stream=True
)
```

## 📊 Content Categories Extracted
